DEPENDENCIES:

You need to install these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/

RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.
I have not extensivly tested the game unter Mac OS, but it should run :-)

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py


If the game is slow, which will probably be the case if you have less then 1.5 Ghz,
try turning off the music AND play in fullscreen for a better gameplay experience.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

You are the little ninja in the bottom right corner. Fight your way
up to the top, collecting as much money as possible.

I suggest playing the Tutorial - click START in the Menu - before the
Endless Wall.

----
